        HelloðŸ‘‹! For those who don't know me, my name is Golden Lin and this website started out as a passion project to 
        cure people's boredom in high school. Coming from a paperless high school, we had iPads which effectively replaced
        backpacks, and obviously, our school was out to get rid of EVERY form of entertainment including the inability to
        access the App Store, numerous gaming websites, and even CHESS!!! I dedicate this website to the students of my
        school and myself to recreate an arcade of my favorite games growing up as a kid. And of course, any suggestions
        for game ideas are appreciated. Feel free to drop a game idea in <a>suggestions</a> and I'll see what I can do.
        Enough about me; Go ahead, have fun, and enjoy the games!

        Fun Fact: The first game created in this arcade was Minesweeper and it was dedicated to my Math teacher who was one
        of the best Minesweeper players in the world. He helped me along with the creation of the game to mimic the game as
        close as possible
